  Masters of Data Science student graduating in 2022.
  <br><br>
  My past work experiences are in finance and theoretical physics research, where I used python, SQL, and excel to help clients and others understand the data collected, or model projections. 
  <br><br>
  I really enjoy learning new tools, exploring data to help solve problems, and helping others understand ideas and data.
